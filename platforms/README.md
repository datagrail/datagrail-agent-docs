# Setup

## Network Communication Requirements

The agent service does not support internal TLS termination, configuring a load balancer or another form of TLS
termination is required. TLS 1.2+ is required to provide secure communication between services.

Ingress will be made to the agent API over port 443 and will arrive from our VPC IP: `52.36.177.91`. Inbound requests
from any other source should be rejected.

The agent will make network requests to the systems you have configured. In addition to these systems, it will also call
back to the DataGrail API via TLS at:

```
https://<customer-name>.datagrail.io
```

It will also place request results in your cloud storage bucket (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage)
over the Amazon API using Pythonâ€™s boto3 package.
